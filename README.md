# KeyCheck

Check if a BTC's wallet private key matches the public address.

This app may be useful for validating paper wallets.

## Null safety
Some of the dependencies do not provide null safety. 
For now, we have to test / run with null safety off, as shown below.

## Test without null safety
```
flutter test --no-sound-null-safety
```

## Run without null safety
```
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```
